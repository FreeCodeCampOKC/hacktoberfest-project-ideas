# Hacktoberfest Project Ideas
A collection of project ideas to work together on for Hacktoberfest. Feel free to add your own!

## Speakers Wanted+
We currently have [this page](https://speakers-wanted.techlahoma.org/) that is driven by GitHub issues with a basic front end. We could improve on this or create a new version using a real back end to practice writing basic CRUD operations with a nicer front end design.

## Who's Who
Kimberly created a [Who's Who Game](https://github.com/FreeCodeCampOKC/hacktoberfest-project-ideas/blob/main/README.md) where you select the correct combination of first and last names given a photo. We could use more pictures and names. We could also consider creating a new version with a real back end to set the amount of choices and photos to guess for one round depending on difficulty.
